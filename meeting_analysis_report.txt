==============================

Date of analysis: 2025-07-29 12:35:32 India Standard Time

This team meeting was a comprehensive review of Lenskart's retail expansion strategy, focusing heavily on the evaluation and approval of potential new store locations across various regions in India, alongside a critical assessment of the current store opening pipeline and performance against targets.

**Overall Summary of the Meeting:**

The meeting served as a crucial forum for the Lenskart team to assess its aggressive store expansion goals for FY26. A significant portion of the discussion revolved around **reviewing the current status of store openings and pipeline metrics**, particularly highlighting a shortfall against both immediate quarterly (149 vs. 165) and annual (500 vs. 650) targets. A major concern was the high number of sites in "To Be Decided" (TBD) status and those dropped after approval, indicating bottlenecks in the deal closure process.

The core of the meeting involved **detailed presentations and evaluations of numerous proposed retail properties** across North (Delhi NCR, Narela), Central (Aligarh, Bareilly, Gorakhpur, Beawar, Sirsa, Dehradun), West (Aurangabad, Pune, Nagpur, Nanded), South (Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Chennai, Madurai, Coonoor), and East (Kolkata, Siliguri, Banka, Cuttack) India. For each property, the team meticulously reviewed:
*   **Physical attributes:** Size, frontage, ceiling height, layout, internal structures, and external views.
*   **Location analysis:** Proximity to existing Lenskart stores, competitors, complementary brands, foot traffic, parking, and overall market potential.
*   **Commercial terms:** Rent per square foot, total rent, maintenance, and projected revenue (GeoIQ vs. Operations' proto).
*   **Landlord commitments:** Discussions often included the need for landlords to undertake renovations, address structural issues, or resolve legal/construction challenges.

Recurring themes throughout the evaluations included:
*   **Rent Negotiation:** A constant push to negotiate down proposed rental costs to meet profitability targets.
*   **Property Suitability:** Strong emphasis on "look and feel," good adjacencies, and sufficient footfall, with several properties being rejected or put on hold due to poor location, small size, or high rent.
*   **Strategic Vision:** Debates arose about the type of store needed (e.g., a larger "flagship" store in Dehradun vs. a smaller replacement), and the importance of securing prime locations even if it means higher initial investment.
*   **Operational Challenges:** Frustration was evident regarding communication gaps, lack of clear ownership for property information, and persistent technical issues with video presentations.
*   **Pipeline Management:** A clear directive to prioritize converting approved deals into opened stores rather than just increasing presentation numbers.

The meeting concluded with a series of specific decisions on individual properties, many conditional on further negotiation or site visits, and a reinforcement of the urgent need to accelerate store openings to meet ambitious targets.

**Main Decisions Made:**

1.  **Strategic Targets & Pipeline:**
    *   The **current projection of 500 store openings is deemed insufficient**; increased efforts are required to meet the annual target of 650 stores.
    *   The **immediate quarterly target of 165 stores must be met**.
    *   The **Maninagar store relocation and Kolaba store are classified as "replacement" stores** (+1/-1) against new store targets, not new additions.
    *   **Rajkot (Gurprasad Chowk) store was officially dropped.**
    *   For **Rajkot, the team decided to focus only on 3 priority catchments**, limiting penetration to 35% (approx. 15 crores annual sales), and to avoid secondary catchments for the time being.

2.  **Property Approvals/Rejections (with conditions):**
    *   **Narela Property:** Approved *only if* the landlord agrees to correct adjacency issues (e.g., creating a wall) and undertakes proper renovation of the building. The target rental for this property is set at **₹1 lakh**.
    *   **Sirsa Property:** **Dropped** due to efficiency issues (small size, unusable basement) and concerns about its overall condition.
    *   **Dehradun Property (initial proposal):** **Dropped** due to concerns about its small size (400-500 sq ft usable area) and potential efficiency issues.
    *   **Dehradun Rajpur Road Property (1200 sq ft replacement):** Effectively **rejected** as a direct replacement; the team insists on a larger, flagship store.
    *   **Aligarh Property (Kishanpur Tiraha / Marris Road):** **Approved to negotiate and fast-track** the securing of this property.
    *   **Bareilly Property (Karamchari Nagar Road):** **Approved to negotiate the rent**, with a target around ₹80,000 INR.
    *   **Gorakhpur Property (Medical College Road):** **Approved to proceed** ("should be done") despite strong reservations from some participants, contingent on rent negotiation (target ₹80-85/sqft).
    *   **Beawar Station Road Property:** **Conditionally approved** with a "Rental ceiling @ 0.65K," requiring building renovation and adjacency rectification.
    *   **Jasola Property:** Status **"Hold,"** to be discussed separately with Amit sir and MMZ sir, and revisited.
    *   **Cuttack Property (Rajbagicha):** Initial inclination is ***not* to proceed** with the property at the proposed rent due to concerns about commercial viability; requires a re-visit for reassessment.
    *   **Mumbai Property (Colaba Causeway):** **Strong approval to proceed with negotiations** for this location.
    *   **Aurangabad Property:** **Approved to proceed with negotiation** (aim for ₹130/sqft).
    *   **Pune Property:** **Approved to proceed** with the understanding that existing wooden boxes/shelves and partitions inside will be removed.
    *   **Nagpur Property:** Considered to have **good potential**; requires further evaluation.
    *   **Thiruporur Property (Chennai):** **Put on hold** due to concerns about its market viability, revenue projections, and potential capital expenditure issues.
    *   **Kothanur Property (Bengaluru):** **Approved to proceed** due to current unavailability of larger spaces, but the team will **continue looking for a bigger store** in the area; rentals to be negotiated down.
    *   **Gunjur Village Varthur Property (Bengaluru):** **Approved to proceed**, with more effort to be put into negotiating with the landlord for better terms, especially regarding rent.
    *   **Nagarbhavi Property (Bengaluru):** **Put on hold** pending the operations visit and further evaluation.
